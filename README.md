## Contributing

This project uses a [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to ensure that all commits follow the litebox convential commit format.
You can learn more about the Litebox config [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellolitebox/commitlint).

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
yarn commit
```

It will ask you to choose a commit type, and then you can write a commit message.
